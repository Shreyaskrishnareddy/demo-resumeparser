## Priority Issues to Fix

### CRITICAL PRIORITY (Fix Immediately)

1. **Work Experience Extraction**
   - Implement pattern recognition for company names, job titles, dates, locations
   - Extract job descriptions and responsibilities
   - Calculate experience duration from date ranges

2. **Skills Classification**
   - Fix skill categorization logic to properly identify mainframe vs web skills
   - Extract skills from "TECHNICAL SKILLS" section
   - Implement domain-specific skill recognition

3. **Experience Calculation**
   - Implement proper date parsing and experience calculation
   - Extract "11+ years" from summary text
   - Calculate from employment history dates

### HIGH PRIORITY (Fix Soon)

4. **Professional Summary Extraction**
   - Extract current role from header and summary
   - Parse experience summary section
   - Identify key competencies and domains

5. **Education Information**
   - Implement education section detection (currently missing entirely)
   - Extract degree, institution, graduation details

### MEDIUM PRIORITY (Enhance Later)

6. **Enhanced Information Extraction**
   - Certifications parsing
   - Projects and achievements
   - Languages and additional qualifications
   - Social media/LinkedIn profiles

## Technical Recommendations

### 1. Pattern Recognition Improvements
- Implement regex patterns for employment history sections
- Add company name recognition from known databases
- Improve date format parsing (various formats used)

### 2. Section-Based Parsing
- Detect resume sections: "EXPERIENCE DETAILS", "TECHNICAL SKILLS", etc.
- Parse each section with appropriate extraction logic
- Handle multi-line job descriptions and responsibilities

### 3. Domain-Specific Skill Classification
- Create mainframe skill taxonomy
- Implement skill categorization based on job role context
- Remove irrelevant skills that don't match candidate's profile

### 4. Experience Calculation Logic
- Parse date ranges in various formats
- Calculate total experience from multiple positions
- Handle current employment ("Present") correctly

## Impact Assessment

**Current Parser Accuracy: ~20%** (Only basic contact information working)

**Expected Accuracy After Fixes: ~85%** (Industry standard for comprehensive parsing)

**Business Impact:**
- Resumes being incorrectly categorized
- Candidates missing from relevant searches
- Poor matching for mainframe positions
- Significant data loss affecting decision-making

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Fix work experience and skills extraction (Critical Priority)
2. **Week 1**: Implement experience calculation and summary extraction
3. **Week 2**: Add education and certification parsing
4. **Week 3**: Testing and validation with similar mainframe resumes
5. **Week 4**: Performance optimization and deployment

This analysis clearly shows that the parser requires significant improvements in multiple areas, with work experience extraction being the most critical failure point.
