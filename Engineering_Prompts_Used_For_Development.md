```
I'm having specific issues with pipe-separated work experience format. The parser isn't correctly extracting company names from entries like:

"Senior Software Engineer | TechCorp Inc | 2020 - Present"

The current regex is failing and returning empty company names. I need you to:

1. Debug the existing work experience parsing logic
2. Add specific handling for pipe-delimited format
3. Ensure proper field mapping: position 0 = job title, position 1 = company, position 2 = dates
4. Add validation to confirm extracted fields are correct
5. Handle edge cases like missing fields or extra pipes
6. Maintain compatibility with other formats (bullet points, etc.)

The parsing logic should:
- Detect pipe-separated format automatically
- Split on pipes and clean whitespace
- Validate each field contains expected data type
- Fall back to other parsing methods if pipe format fails

Show me the specific code fixes and test with various pipe-separated examples.
```

### Prompt 16: Skills Extraction Debugging - Prefix Issues
```
I have a specific problem with skills extraction. The parser is finding skills but including category prefixes:

Instead of: "Python", "JavaScript", "React"
I'm getting: "Programming Languages: Python", "Web Technologies: JavaScript", "Frontend: React"

I need you to:

1. Analyze the skills extraction logic and identify where prefixes are being included
2. Create a normalization function that removes common prefixes like:
   - "Programming Languages:"
   - "Web Technologies:"
   - "Cloud & DevOps:"
   - "Databases:"
   - "Frameworks:"

3. Handle variations like:
   - Different punctuation (colon, dash, etc.)
   - Case variations
   - Multiple skills on same line after prefix

4. Ensure the cleaned skills are still properly categorized
5. Add validation to ensure we're not removing valid parts of skill names
6. Test with various resume formats that have different skills section styles

Show me the specific code changes and test with examples of problematic skills extraction.
```

### Prompt 17: Schema Compatibility Issues
```
My accuracy testing is failing because there's a mismatch between the JSON schema output and what the test expects. Here's the issue:

The test is looking for company names at:
`result['EmploymentHistory']['Positions'][0]['Company']`

But the parser is outputting:
`result['EmploymentHistory']['Positions'][0]['Employer']['Name']`

I need you to:

1. Review the current JSON schema structure
2. Update either the parser output or the test expectations for consistency
3. Ensure backward compatibility if there are existing integrations
4. Handle both flat and nested object structures
5. Add schema validation to prevent future mismatches

The schema should support:
- Nested objects for complex data (Employer with Name, Industry, etc.)
- Flat access paths for simple integrations
- Backward compatibility with existing field names
- Clear documentation of schema structure

Fix the schema compatibility and update all related code.
```

### Prompt 18: Date Parsing Enhancement
```
I'm having inconsistent results with employment date extraction. Sometimes dates are extracted correctly, sometimes not. I need comprehensive date parsing that handles:

1. Common Formats:
   - "Jan 2020 - Present"
   - "January 2020 - December 2023"
   - "2020-01 to 2023-12"
   - "2020 - 2023"
   - "Jan 2020 - Jan 2023"

2. Special Cases:
   - "Present", "Current", "Ongoing"
   - Date ranges with missing end dates
   - Single dates (graduation, certification dates)
   - Approximate dates ("circa 2020", "~2020")

3. Validation:
   - Ensure start date is before end date
   - Flag impossible date ranges
   - Handle overlapping employment periods
   - Detect career gaps

4. Output Standardization:
   - ISO 8601 format for consistency
   - Separate start_date and end_date fields
   - Boolean flag for current positions
   - Confidence scores for date accuracy

Create a comprehensive DateParser class and integrate it with work experience and education extraction.
