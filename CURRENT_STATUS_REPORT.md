---

### ‚ùå UNRESOLVED CATEGORIES

#### 1. Projects (0/4 issues - 0%)
**Status:** Not extracted for ANY resume
- ‚ùå Project Name: Missing in all 4 resumes
- ‚ùå Description, Company, Role, Start/End Dates: All missing

**Root Cause:** Resumes may not have dedicated Projects sections, or parser doesn't infer projects from work experience

**Priority:** HIGH - Projects are important for technical candidates

#### 2. Social Media Links (0/4 issues - 0%)
**Status:** Not extracted for ANY resume
- ‚ùå LinkedIn, GitHub, etc.: Missing in all 4 resumes

**Root Cause:** Parser not extracting social media URLs

**Priority:** MEDIUM - Social profiles increasingly important

#### 3. Relevant Skills (0/4 issues - 0%)
**Status:** Not extracted as separate field
- ‚ùå Skills are extracted, but no "RelevantSkills" array

**Root Cause:** May be a field naming issue - skills are in "ListOfSkills" but not "RelevantSkills"

**Priority:** LOW - Skills ARE being extracted, just not in separate relevance field

#### 4. Middle Name (1/4 issues - 25%)
**Status:** Only extracted for Resume 2
- ‚ùå Resume 1, 3, 4: Not extracted

**Root Cause:** Middle names may not be present in resumes, or parser needs enhancement

**Priority:** LOW - Many resumes don't include middle names

## üìà COMPARISON TO PREVIOUS REPORTS

### Previous Claims vs Current Reality

**Previous Report Claimed:**
> "100% SUCCESS ACHIEVED - 42/42 issues resolved"

**Current Analysis Shows:**
> "67.2% Resolution Rate - 41/61 issues resolved"

**Discrepancy Analysis:**
The previous reports appear to have been overly optimistic. Our fresh analysis directly comparing the Excel verification file against actual parsed output reveals:

1. **Projects**: Claimed as "inferred from work experience" - Actually **NOT present** in parsed output
2. **Social Media**: Claimed as "extracted correctly" - Actually **NOT present** in parsed output
3. **Relevant Skills**: Claimed as "100% extraction" - Actually **NOT in separate field**
4. **Achievements**: Claimed for all resumes - Actually only in **2 out of 4** resumes

The parser has made **substantial progress** with a **67.2% resolution rate**. The core functionality for screening candidates (Overall Summary, Work Experience, Key Responsibilities) is working excellently at 73-100% resolution.

**Current Status: FUNCTIONAL BUT INCOMPLETE**

The parser is **suitable for production use** for basic resume screening, but **needs additional work** on:
- Projects extraction (high priority)
- Social media links (medium priority)
- Edge cases in education and achievements (medium priority)

**Estimated Effort to 90%:** 20-30 hours of focused development work
