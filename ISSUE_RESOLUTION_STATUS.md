## REMAINING ISSUES

### 1. Education Field Parsing (Minor - 5% impact)
**Issue:** FieldOfStudy sometimes contains institution name instead of just the field
**Example:** Shows "SRM University - 2009" instead of "Computer Science"
**Impact:** Data is present, just needs better field separation
**Priority:** Low
**Fix Required:** Enhance education parsing logic to better separate degree, institution, field, and year

### 2. Certification Dates (Context-Dependent)
**Issue:** Certification issued dates empty when not specified in resume
**Impact:** Only affects resumes where dates are not explicitly mentioned
**Current Behavior:** CORRECT - parser doesn't hallucinate data
**Priority:** Low (by design)
**Note:** For resumes with explicit dates (like Ahmad's), dates ARE extracted
