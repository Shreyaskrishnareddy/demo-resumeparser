## ❌ REMAINING ISSUES (10 Total)

### Critical Issues

#### 1. **Email Address** (4 failures - HIGH PRIORITY)
- ❌ Resume 1, 2, 3, 4: EmailAddress field empty

- **Recommendation**: Map "Email" → "EmailAddress" in PersonalDetails

#### 2. **Company Name** (2 failures - HIGH PRIORITY)
- ❌ Resume 1 (Venkat): Employer field empty for all 6 jobs
- ❌ Resume 2 (Krupakar): Employer field empty for all 6 jobs
- **Root Cause**: CLIENT: prefix handling issue - company names not being extracted
- **Impact**: High - Work experience incomplete without company names
- **Recommendation**: Fix company extraction for CLIENT: format in DOCX files

#### 3. **Work Location** (2 failures - MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- ❌ Resume 1: Location field empty
- ❌ Resume 2: Location field empty
- **Root Cause**: Location extraction logic not handling all formats
- **Impact**: Medium - Nice to have but not critical
- **Recommendation**: Enhance location pattern matching

#### 4. **Certifications** (2 failures - LOW PRIORITY)
- ❌ Resume 2: No certifications extracted
- **Root Cause**: Resume may not have certifications, or format not recognized
- **Impact**: Low - May be valid if resume has no certifications
- **Recommendation**: Manual verification needed to confirm if certifications exist
